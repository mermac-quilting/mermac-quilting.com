                     <p>Merrilee MacWilliam, owner and operator of the Mermac Design Quilt Studio, has been a professional longarm quilter for 17 years, with more than 2000 quilts completed and hundreds of satisfied customers. Merrilee’s experiences with design choice, thread choice, machine set up and quilt management all go to work for you when you bring her your quilt for professional finishing. If finishing yourself, she is there to guide your choices in order for you to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
                     <p>Always with the future of quilting in mind, we now have a <strong>Nolting NV</strong> long arm quilting machine with the newest <strong>Intelliquilter</strong> computerized quilting system installed for professional finishing. Whether you are interested in an all over pantograph or custom block by block creativity, there are literally thousands of designs to choose from. We have many installed designs in the studio, but the designs of your choice are just a download away!</p>
                     <p>The Mermac Design Quilt Studio is located on the lower level of our home, accessed by a stairway. It is a comfortably finished space, both heated and cooled for the season. The studio is organized with many tools to assist in all aspects of quilt finishing- marking tools, templates, stencils and pantographs- all of which are available to customers.</p>

                     <p>Whether you are after the perfection of computer guided stitching or the more edgy free form of hand guided quilting, Mermac Design will work for you. With the Intelliquilter® Computerized system on our Nolting NV 24, literally thousands of design choices are available to you. Many holiday, novelty and texture designs are currently available in our library.

                     <p style="text-align: left;">All quilting services are charged on a per square inch basis depending on the type of quilting, density of design, set up time, thread changes and detailing required. Please see our <a title="Pricing" href="/pricing/">pricing page</a> for specific details. To estimate your quilting costs, use the following formula</p>
                     <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Length x Width = Area</strong><br />
                     <strong>Area x Price/sq.in. = Quilting Charge</strong></p>

                     <h2>Scheduling Appointments</h2>
                     <p>Because we are working out of our home, business is conducted <b>by appointment only.</b> Every effort will be made to accommodate people’s schedules, however walk ins are not available at this time. Our schedule is flexible, therefore we can accommodate evening and weekend appointments. However, please keep in mind the size of your project when scheduling an appointment. Queen and king sized quilts take several hours to complete and will not be scheduled later than 4:00 pm to be completed by 9:00pm.</p>
                     <p>Your rental time starts when you begin loading your quilt on the frame. You are charged an hourly rate in quarter hour increments. If you have design questions or want ideas to practice before you actually begin, please consider scheduling a free “pre-rental consultation”. Be ready to quilt when you arrive so planning doesn’t increase the cost of your rental.</p>

You are not limited to one color of thread in your quilt, however multiple thread changes will add to your rental time.  Batting is also available for purchase at the studio, however is not required.
